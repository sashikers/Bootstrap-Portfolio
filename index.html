				<h2>Hello!</h2>
				<div class="row">

					<p>The 22-ounce brown bomber pours with a thickness and leaves three fingers of stodgy head. A head that does not want to move. Slightly hazy reddish-amber color. Spicy herbal hops with suggestions of wintergreen, pine sap and grapefruit rind. Some alcoholic fruity esters, rum, cane sugar and toasted malt in the nose as well. So damn smooth and creamy, with a sumptuously full body. Light brown sugar on the palate, then a fume of well-placed alcohol, and then the hops show up bitter as ever, but not a sharp bitterness or astringency. Big tobacco, citrus rind, pine sap and mint flavor from the hops stick to the taste buds for a while. Lots of malt behind the hops; toasted bread, caramel and yeast dough come to mind. A bit fruity with pineapple, papaya and ripe mango. Sting of alcohol in the end with a bittersweet finish.</p>
					<p>Dark, lovely, luscious. The deep, dark brown color hints at the flavors within. With an aroma reminiscent of chocolate and freshly baked cookies, this beer is smooth, silky, creamy, full-bodied, roasty, toasty, and slightly nutty. This is one beautifully balanced, rich, and exquisite stout.</p>
					<p>This quad is insanely fluffy-smooth on the palate, with an even, full-body and semi-sharp carbonation edge that knocks the silky bliss down for a moment. The softness returns as a mildly sweet malt profile, with dried raisins, powdery dark chocolate, sweet cherries soaked in alcohol and a slight tartness of strawberries. Hop character coats with a leafy feel on the palate, yielding a delicate noble hop bitterness, as well as a touch of cheesiness and pithiness. This melds with spicy phenols, which lends a slight medicinal flavor that wanders within the spicy alcohol and heat. Finish is very dry, with residual yeast and crackery lingers.</p>
					<p>The 12-ounce bottle unleashes what appears to be a well-carbonated brew, with thousands of tiny bubbles cascading throughout the beer and forming a very tight white foam head that retains extremely well and leaves rings of sticking lace as we drink, thanks, no doubt, to the abundance of hops. What lies beneath is a peachy amber-colored brew with a touch of haze running through it. Nose is floral, like orange blossoms, with some citric rind and soft apple. Ultra-smooth on the palate, with a silky creaminess up front and an even consistency to the end. Mineral notes. Sharp citric smack, with grapefruit, salt, lemon rinds and a piney edge. Crisp bite. Leafy undertones. Apple and pear notes follow, with a touch of pale malt sweetness and orange-like fruitiness mingling with light hop oils. Bitter, grainy and drying in the finish with just enough residual sweetness to make the linger enjoyable.</p>
